## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Build Process
**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT attempt to build or compile from terminal/command line.
- Building must be done through Unreal Engine Editor or by the user
- Terminal build commands are not available in this environment
- For build errors, provide code fixes and let the user handle compilation
- Focus on code changes and documentation updates only

## üîß Technical Debt & Optimizations

### Performance
- [ ] Implement object pooling for projectiles/VFX
- [x] ~~Cache frequently accessed components~~ COMPLETE: HUD now caches all ability components
- [x] ~~Optimize tick functions to event-driven~~ COMPLETE: Death system and AI now event/timer-based

### Code Quality
- [x] ~~Extract magic numbers to configuration~~ COMPLETE: Created GameplayConfig.h
- [x] ~~Add comprehensive error handling~~ COMPLETE: Created ErrorHandling.h utilities
- [ ] Refactor ability inheritance hierarchy
- [ ] Standardize damage calculation pipeline
- [ ] Add unit tests for resource calculations

### Blueprint Integration
- [x] All ability components properly exposed
- [x] Resource bars bound to delegates
- [x] Input system fully configured
- [ ] Environmental interaction blueprints

## üìä Testing Framework

### Console Commands
```cpp
// Development commands
SetWP <0-100>              // Test WP thresholds
SetHeat <0-100>            // Test Heat mechanics
SetStamina <0-100>         // Test ability availability
ForceAbilityLoss <count>   // Test survivor buffs
SpawnInteractable <type>   // Test environment objects
TriggerThreshold <WP|Heat> // Test 100% mechanics
ForceUltimateMode          // Force activate ultimate mode
CacheAbilities             // Refresh ability tracking
```

### Debug Visualizations
- Purple line: Active Mindmeld connections
- Blue circles: Hackable object ranges
- Orange zones: Forgeable heat areas
- Green indicators: Resource pickup locations

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why No GAS?
1. **Full Control**: Custom implementation allows precise resource mechanics
2. **Performance**: Avoid GAS overhead for our specific needs
3. **Learning**: Better understanding of ability system internals
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify for unique mechanics

### Component Communication
```
Player Input ‚Üí Ability Component ‚Üí Resource Manager
                    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
              Threshold Manager ‚Üê ‚Üí Combat Events
                    ‚Üì
                HUD Updates
```

## üêõ Known Issues

- [x] ~~First-person camera causing access violation crashes~~ FIXED: Component validation
- [x] ~~Slash ability blocked at 100% WP despite being basic~~ FIXED: Basic ability bypass
- [ ] Combo window doesn't reset on ability disable
- [ ] Heat dissipation continues during cutscenes

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Ability queuing feels unresponsive
- [ ] Resource bar animations lag behind actual values
- [ ] Enemy AI doesn't react to environmental changes

### Low Priority
- [ ] Debug lines persist after enemy death
- [ ] Console command feedback is minimal
- [ ] Third-person camera clips through walls

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Current Stats (Debug Build - Post-Optimization)

- **Memory**: 2.0GB baseline, 2.6GB peak ‚¨áÔ∏è
- **CPU**: 12-15% usage during combat ‚¨áÔ∏è
- **Draw Calls**: 800-1200 depending on VFX
- **Tick Functions**: Reduced from ~50 to minimal essential ‚¨áÔ∏è

### Optimization Targets
- Maintain 60+ FPS with 20 enemies
- Reduce memory footprint by 20%
- Implement LODs for enemy models
- Batch similar VFX draw calls

## üîç Code Review Checklist

Before implementing new features:
- [ ] Follow existing component architecture

- [ ] Update ResourceManager for new costs
- [ ] Implement proper cooldown handling
- [ ] Add debug visualization options
- [ ] Document in code comments
- [ ] Update this status document
