## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Status


### ‚úÖ Core Systems Complete
- **Single Resource System**: WP only (Stamina completely removed)
- **11 Combat Abilities**: All path-specific abilities with WP costs
- **Ultimate Ability System**: At 100% WP, abilities transform to ultimate versions
  - All 5 combat abilities have working ultimate forms
  - Proper ultimate execution and permanent disabling after use
- **Basic Ability System**: Slash, Jump, and Dash always available
- **Strategic Ability Loss**: Player chooses which ultimate to use (and lose)
- **Enemy AI**: Basic behaviors with Mindmeld corruption mechanic
- **Input System**: Enhanced Input with runtime remapping
- **HUD**: Real-time updates for WP and cooldowns
- **Menu System**: Complete C++ implementation with Main Menu, Pause, and Game Over screens

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (2025-07-11)
- **Stamina System Removal**: Complete removal of stamina from project
  - Removed all stamina references from code
  - Updated IResourceConsumer interface (maintained for compatibility)
  - Updated all abilities to use WP only or be free
  - Cleaned up HUD to remove stamina bar
- **Dash Ability Fixes**: Fixed movement direction issues
  - Dash now uses movement input direction instead of crosshair
  - Fixed input axis swapping (W was going right, etc.)
  - Added special case: W+Dash follows camera angle for vertical movement
  - Other directions (A, S, D) maintain horizontal movement
- **Ultimate System Fixes**: Resolved critical WP system issues
  - Fixed WP instant reset at 100% preventing ultimate ability use
  - Removed grace period - ultimates available immediately at 100% WP
  - Fixed ability disabling - ultimates cannot be reused after sacrifice
  - Added CanExecute() checks to all input handlers
  - Improved ultimate execution flow and state management
- **Engine Editor Customization**: Full ultimate ability customization
  - All ultimate abilities now have editable properties in engine editor
  - Base ultimate properties: Range, Damage, Duration multipliers (1.0-10.0x)
  - Ability-specific properties organized in clear categories
  - Fixed property naming conflicts between base and derived classes
- **Enhanced Targeting System**: Improved combo execution for TPS gameplay
  - Ground vs Air targeting behaviors for different combat contexts
  - Closest enemy priority when on ground to prevent targeting past enemies
  - Sophisticated scoring system for air combat (angle + vertical + distance)
  - Increased aim forgiveness radius (180-200 units) for easier targeting
  - Debug visualization with color-coded targeting indicators

### ‚úÖ Previously Completed (2025-07-10)
- **Combo System**: Simple input-based detection with two combos implemented
  - DashSlashCombo (Phantom Strike): Teleport backstab
  - JumpSlashCombo (Aerial Rave): Shockwave slam
  - Real-time based time slow system with proper cleanup
  - HitStop disabled during combos to avoid conflicts
- **Major Refactoring**: Complete Forge path removal and architecture cleanup
  - See [PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md](PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md) for details

### üîÑ In Development
- **Environmental Interactions**: Hackable object system
- **Ultimate Visual Effects**: Enhanced VFX for ultimate abilities


### üéØ Next Sprint Focus

#### Environmental System Architecture
```cpp
// Proposed component structure
UInteractableComponent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UHackableComponent    // Data nodes, terminals, turrets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UForgeableComponent   // Metal objects, heat vents, barriers  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ USharedInteractable   // Resource stations, combo shrines
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Build Process
**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT attempt to build or compile from terminal/command line.
- Building must be done through Unreal Engine Editor or by the user
- Terminal build commands are not available in this environment
- For build errors, provide code fixes and let the user handle compilation
- Focus on code changes and documentation updates only

## üîß Technical Debt & Optimizations

### Performance
- [ ] Implement object pooling for projectiles/VFX
- [x] ~~Cache frequently accessed components~~ COMPLETE: HUD now caches all ability components
- [x] ~~Optimize tick functions to event-driven~~ COMPLETE: Death system and AI now event/timer-based
- [x] ~~Remove unused resource systems~~ COMPLETE: Stamina system removed

### Code Quality
- [x] ~~Extract magic numbers to configuration~~ COMPLETE: Created GameplayConfig.h
- [x] ~~Add comprehensive error handling~~ COMPLETE: Created ErrorHandling.h utilities
- [x] ~~Fix ability state management~~ COMPLETE: Added bIsDisabled flag and proper state tracking
- [ ] Refactor ability inheritance hierarchy
- [ ] Standardize damage calculation pipeline
- [ ] Add unit tests for resource calculations

### Blueprint Integration
- [x] All ability components properly exposed
- [x] Resource bars bound to delegates
- [x] Input system fully configured
- [ ] Environmental interaction blueprints

## üìä Testing Framework

### Console Commands
```cpp
// Development commands
SetWP <0-100>              // Test WP thresholds
ForceAbilityLoss <count>   // Test survivor buffs
SpawnInteractable <type>   // Test environment objects
TriggerThreshold <WP>      // Test 100% mechanics
ForceUltimateMode          // Force activate ultimate mode
CacheAbilities             // Refresh ability tracking
```

### Debug Visualizations
- Purple line: Active Mindmeld connections
- Blue circles: Hackable object ranges
- Orange zones: Forgeable heat areas
- Green indicators: Resource pickup locations

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why No GAS?
1. **Full Control**: Custom implementation allows precise resource mechanics
2. **Performance**: Avoid GAS overhead for our specific needs
3. **Learning**: Better understanding of ability system internals
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify for unique mechanics

### Component Communication
```
Player Input ‚Üí Ability Component ‚Üí Resource Manager
                    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
              Threshold Manager ‚Üê ‚Üí Combat Events
                    ‚Üì
                HUD Updates
```

## üêõ Known Issues

### Current Issues
- None critical - all major crashes and bugs resolved

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Ability queuing feels unresponsive
- [ ] WP bar animations lag behind actual values
- [ ] Enemy AI doesn't react to environmental changes

### Low Priority
- [ ] Debug lines persist after enemy death
- [ ] Console command feedback is minimal
- [ ] Third-person camera clips through walls

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Current Stats (Debug Build)
- **FPS**: 120+ (empty level), 90-100 (combat)
- **Memory**: 2.0GB baseline, 2.6GB peak
- **CPU**: 12-15% usage during combat
- **Draw Calls**: 800-1200 depending on VFX

### Optimization Targets
- Maintain 60+ FPS with 20 enemies
- Reduce memory footprint by 20%
- Implement LODs for enemy models
- Batch similar VFX draw calls

## üîç Code Review Checklist

Before implementing new features:
- [ ] Follow existing component architecture
- [ ] Add console commands for testing
- [ ] Update ResourceManager for new costs
- [ ] Implement proper cooldown handling
- [ ] Add debug visualization options
- [ ] Document in code comments
- [ ] Update this status document
- [ ] DO NOT attempt terminal builds - provide fixes only
