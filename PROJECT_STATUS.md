# Blackhole Project Status
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.5  
**Language**: C++ with Blueprint integration  
**Genre**: Hybrid hacker-forge warrior action game  
**Date**: 2025-07-04

## Project Overview
A tactical action game featuring dual-path combat where players choose between Hacker and Forge modes before each level, each with unique abilities and resource systems. Core gameplay revolves around resource management, combo chaining, and adaptive combat as abilities are dynamically lost based on Willpower thresholds.

## 🎯 Core Systems Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Dual Resource System**: Stamina + WP corruption (Hacker) / Stamina + Heat (Forge)
- **Path System**: Players choose Hacker or Forge path before entering each level
- **11 Combat Abilities**: All path-specific abilities with correct resource consumption
- **WP Corruption System**: 0% = good state, higher WP = fewer abilities
- **Hacker Enemy Mindmeld**: Continuously adds WP corruption to player with line of sight
- **Threshold Manager**: WP corruption-based ability loss (inverted thresholds)
- **Combo System**: 2-second chain window with Mini Combo and Combo Surge rewards
- **Enhanced Input System**: UE5 input actions with runtime remapping support
- **HUD Integration**: Real-time resource bars, path indicators, cooldown displays
- **Cheat Manager**: Console commands for testing (SetWP, SetHeat, SetPath, etc.)

### 🔧 Core Architecture
```
Component Hierarchy:
├── ResourceManager (GameInstance Subsystem)
├── ThresholdManager (World Subsystem)  
├── ComboTracker (Component)
├── 11 Ability Components (Path-organized)
└── 4 Attribute Components (Health, Stamina, WP, Heat)
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

### Path System
**Hacker Path** (Cyan theme):
- Focus: Speed, precision, technical mastery
- Resources: Stamina + WP corruption (WP increases with use)
- Abilities: Gravity Pull, Pulse Hack, Firewall Breach
- Utilities: Dash/jump for mobility (stamina cost only)

**Forge Path** (Orange theme):
- Focus: Power, impact, destructive force  
- Resources: Stamina + Heat consumption (combat abilities only)
- Abilities: Molten Mace, Heat Shield, Blast Charge, Hammer Strike
- Utilities: Damaging dash/jump with stamina cost only

### Ability Loss System (WP Corruption)
- **0-10% WP**: All abilities available (good state)
- **10-30% WP**: Lose 1 random ability (system strain)
- **30-60% WP**: Lose 2 random abilities (system overload)
- **>60% WP**: Lose 3 abilities (critical corruption)

**Survivor Buffs**: +25% damage, -15% cooldown, -5 WP corruption per lost ability

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Performance Features
- **Event-driven updates** instead of polling
- **Cached component references** for frequent access
- **Modular component architecture** for easy expansion
- **No GAS dependency** for full control over ability system

### Testing Infrastructure
Console commands available:
```
SetWP <amount>        - Set WillPower (0-100)
SetHeat <amount>      - Set Heat (0-100)  
SetPath <Hacker|Forge> - Switch character path (Development only)
StartCombat           - Enable threshold tracking
EndCombat             - Reset disabled abilities
ResetResources        - Reset all resources to max
ShowDebugInfo         - Display current status
```
