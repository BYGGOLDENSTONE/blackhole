### üîÑ Latest Fixes (2025-07-15)

#### WP Energy System Transformation (2025-07-15)
**Complete Paradigm Shift**: WP transformed from corruption to energy/mana system
**Previous System**: WP started at 0, abilities added corruption, 100% = death
**New Energy System**:
- WP = 100: Full energy (starting state)
- WP = 0: Critical state (ultimate mode)
- Abilities consume WP as energy cost
- Enemy attacks drain player's WP
- Killing enemies restores WP (+10 weak, +20 normal, +30 strong)
- Combos restore WP (+15 per basic combo)
- Critical state: 5-second timer, damage immunity, all abilities become ultimates
- Using ultimate: Resets WP to 100, permanently disables that ability

**Technical Implementation**:
- `ResourceManager::ConsumeWillPower()` - Allows overdrawing to reach 0
- `ThresholdManager::ActivateUltimateMode()` - Auto-caches abilities if needed
- `AbilityComponent::ValidateResources()` - Always allows use when WP > 0
- Player damage immunity when WP = 0 (critical state)
- WP clamped at 0, never goes negative

**New Mechanics**:
- **WP = Energy**: Starts at 100 (full energy), abilities consume WP
- **Combat Loop**: Enemy attacks reduce WP, kills restore WP
- **Combo Rewards**: Successful combos restore WP
  - Dash + Slash: +15 WP
  - Jump + Slash: +15 WP  
  - Dash + Wall Run: +10 WP
- **Ultimate at 0 WP**: Running out of energy activates ultimate abilities
- **Critical Timer**: 5-second timer starts at 0 WP - use ultimate or die
- **Ultimate Reset**: Using ultimate resets WP to 100 but disables that ability
- **Enemy Kills**: Different enemies give different WP rewards
  - Combat Enemy: +10 WP
  - Agile Enemy: +15 WP
  - Tank Enemy: +20 WP
  - Hacker Enemy: +25 WP

**Implementation Details**:
- ResourceManager: `ConsumeWillPower()` now reduces WP for abilities
- AbilityComponent: `ConsumeAbilityResources()` consumes WP instead of adding
- ComboAbilityComponent: Added `WPRewardAmount` property for combo rewards
- BaseEnemy: Added `WPRewardOnKill` property and grants WP on death
- ThresholdManager: Removed 100% WP death conditions, activates at 0% WP
- BlackholeHUD: Dynamic WP color (Green=healthy, Yellow=warning, Red=critical)

**Files Modified**: 
- ResourceManager.h/cpp - Flipped WP logic, starts at 100
- AbilityComponent.cpp - Consumes WP instead of adding
- ComboAbilityComponent - Rewards WP on successful combos
- WallRunComponent - Rewards WP for dash+wall run combo
- All enemy classes - Grant WP on death
- ThresholdManager - Ultimate mode at 0 WP
- BlackholeHUD - Updated UI for energy system
- GameplayConfig.h - INITIAL_WILLPOWER = 100

**Result**: Created unique risk/reward loop where managing energy is crucial but running out grants powerful ultimates

### üîÑ Previous Fixes (2025-07-13)

#### WP Ultimate System Fix
**Issue**: WP not staying at 100% until ultimate used  
**Root Cause**: ResourceManager and WillPowerComponent were not synchronized  
**Solution**: Added `SyncWillPowerComponent()` to keep both systems in sync  
**Result**: WP now correctly stays at 100% until ultimate ability used, then resets

#### Slash Ability Free Cost
**Change**: Removed WP cost from slash ability (was 15 WP, now 0 WP)  
**Benefit**: Players can slash freely without energy cost  
**Impact**: More fluid basic combat, slash as unlimited basic attack

#### Critical Timer System
**Feature**: 5-second urgency timer when WP reaches 0%  
**Mechanic**: Player has 5 seconds to use ANY ultimate ability or die  
**UI**: Flashing "CRITICAL ERROR" message with countdown and screen border  
**Impact**: Adds intense pressure and urgency to ultimate ability decisions

#### Cost Field Cleanup (2025-07-12)
**Issue**: Abilities had TWO resource fields - confusing designers  
**Problem**: Both `Cost` and `WP Corruption Added` appeared in editor  
**Root Cause**: Legacy `Cost` field was never removed when `WPCost` system was implemented  
**Solution**: Completely removed redundant `Cost` field and `GetCost()` function  
**Files Modified**: 13 ability component .cpp files, AbilityComponent.h  
**Result**: Clean editor interface with only one resource field (`WP Corruption Added`)

#### Basic Combo Classification Fix (2025-07-12)
**Issue**: Dash+Slash combo was resetting WP during critical timer without ultimate use  
**Root Cause**: All combos inherited `bIsBasicAbility = false` from ComboAbilityComponent  
**Problem Flow**:
1. Player reaches 100% WP ‚Üí Critical timer starts
2. Player uses Dash+Slash combo
3. System sees `!IsBasicAbility()` ‚Üí Treats as ultimate ability
4. WP resets to 0 ‚ùå (without actual ultimate use)

**Solution**: Classify combos based on their component abilities  
- **Basic + Basic = Basic Combo**
  - Dash (basic) + Slash (basic) = DashSlashCombo (now basic)
  - Jump (basic) + Slash (basic) = JumpSlashCombo (now basic)
- **Advanced + Any = Advanced Combo** (future combos)

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// DashSlashCombo and JumpSlashCombo constructors:
bIsBasicAbility = true;  // Override parent's false
WPCost = 0.0f;          // Basic abilities don't consume energy
```

**Result**: Basic combos no longer interfere with critical timer or ultimate system

#### Critical Timer Death Interference Fix (2025-07-12)
**Issue**: Critical timer stopping and WP resetting when enemy hits player during critical state  
**User Report**: *"critical timer stops and wp resetted when an enemy hit me without using ultimate ability"*

**Root Cause**: Player death logic was clearing ALL timers, including critical timer
```cpp
// In ABlackholePlayerCharacter::Die() - PROBLEMATIC CODE
World->GetTimerManager().ClearAllTimersForObject(this); // Cleared critical timer!
```

**Bug Flow**:
1. Player reaches 100% WP ‚Üí Critical timer starts (5 seconds) ‚è∞
2. Enemy hits player ‚Üí Player health drops to 0 üíî
3. `IntegrityComponent::OnReachedZero.Broadcast()` ‚Üí `Die()` called
4. `ClearAllTimersForObject(this)` clears critical timer ‚ùå
5. System thinks timer expired/ultimate used ‚Üí WP resets to 0 ‚ùå

**Solution**: Remove indiscriminate timer clearing that interferes with critical systems
- Removed `ClearAllTimersForObject(this)` call from player death
- Removed timer clearing from ability components during death
- Added defensive logging to detect timer interference
- Let ThresholdManager exclusively manage critical timer lifecycle

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// REMOVED - was clearing critical timer
// World->GetTimerManager().ClearAllTimersForObject(this);

// ADDED - defensive logging
if (ThresholdMgr->IsCriticalTimerActive()) {
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("WARNING: Player died while critical timer active!"));
}
```

#### Critical Timer Enemy Ability Bug Fix (2025-07-12)  
**Issue**: Critical timer stopping when enemy uses abilities during player's critical state  
**User Report**: *"when enemy hit player, players integrity drops to 90 but critical state is ended and players wp resetted to 0"*

**Root Cause Discovered**: ThresholdManager was treating **enemy ability use** as **player ultimate ability use**!

**Log Analysis Revealed**:
```
LogTemp: Warning: Ability BlockAbility: Execute() called  ‚Üê ENEMY ABILITY!
LogTemp: Warning: ThresholdManager: OnAbilityExecuted called for BlockAbility  ‚Üê WRONG!
LogTemp: Warning: Critical timer active, non-basic ability used - treating as ultimate ability  ‚Üê BUG!
LogTemp: Error: !!! DEACTIVATE ULTIMATE MODE CALLED (WILL RESET WP) !!!  ‚Üê WP RESET!
```

**Problem**: `OnAbilityExecuted()` was listening to ALL ability executions (player + enemy)

**Solution**: Added player ownership check to filter out enemy abilities:
```cpp
// CRITICAL FIX: Only process PLAYER abilities, ignore enemy abilities
if (!PlayerCharacter || Ability->GetOwner() != PlayerCharacter)
{
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, VeryVerbose, TEXT("ThresholdManager: Ignoring enemy ability %s"), *Ability->GetName());
    return;
}
```

**Result**: ThresholdManager now only responds to actual player ability use, ignoring all enemy abilities

#### Wall Run System Implementation (2025-07-12)
**Feature**: Complete wall running system for enhanced cyberpunk movement
**Requirements**: Player must be airborne to start, press W to continue, SPACE for diagonal wall jump
**Integration**: Full integration with existing ability system

**Key Features**:
- **Air Requirement**: Wall run only starts when player is jumping/falling, not from ground
- **Momentum Preservation**: Dash speed (3000) is preserved during wall run, gradual slowdown after
- **Height Maintenance**: Player runs at consistent height along walls
- **Tight Wall Detection**: Reduced detection distance (45 units) for close wall running
- **Diagonal Wall Jumps**: SPACE key launches diagonally based on wall side (using Launch() method)
- **Cooldown System**: 1.5s cooldown after wall run ends to prevent immediate re-attachment
- **Wall Verification**: Timer checks every second to prevent "wall running in air" when walls end
- **Ability Restrictions**: Blocks dash and regular jump during wall run, allows advanced abilities

**Technical Implementation**:
```cpp
// State machine with enum
enum class EWallRunState : uint8 {
    None, Detecting, WallRunning, Falling, CoyoteTime
};

// Wall verification every second
FTimerHandle WallVerificationTimer;
void VerifyWallPresence(); // Ends wall run if no wall detected

// Momentum preservation
if (CurrentSpeed > Settings.WallRunSpeed) {
    CurrentWallRunSpeed = CurrentSpeed; // Keep dash speed
}

// Diagonal wall jump
FVector WallJumpVelocity = CalculateWallJumpVelocity();
MovementComponent->Launch(WallJumpVelocity); // Reliable launch
```

**Files Modified**:
- `Components/Movement/WallRunComponent.h/cpp` - Core wall run implementation
- `BlackholePlayerCharacter.cpp` - Jump input handling for wall jump
- `BlackholeHUD.cpp` - UI display for wall run status
- `AbilityComponent.cpp` - Ability restriction checks during wall run

**Result**: Fluid cyberpunk movement system with proper physics, safety checks, and UI integration

#### AI State Machine Implementation (2025-07-13)
**Feature**: Complete refactor of enemy AI from if/else chains to proper state machine architecture
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability, extensibility, and debugging capabilities

**Previous Issues with If/Else Approach**:
- Complex nested conditions difficult to debug
- State transitions scattered throughout code
- No clear separation of concerns
- Difficult to add new behaviors
- Poor scalability

**New State Machine Architecture**:
```cpp
// Base state machine class
class BLACKHOLE_API UBaseEnemyStateMachine : public UObject
{
    UPROPERTY()
    class ABaseEnemy* OwnerEnemy;
    
    EEnemyState CurrentState;
    
    virtual void StateLogic(float DeltaTime);
    virtual void Enter_Idle();
    virtual void Update_Idle(float DeltaTime);
    // ... other state methods
};

// Specialized state machines for each enemy type
class UCombatEnemyStateMachine : public UBaseEnemyStateMachine
class UAgileEnemyStateMachine : public UBaseEnemyStateMachine
class UTankEnemyStateMachine : public UBaseEnemyStateMachine
class UHackerEnemyStateMachine : public UBaseEnemyStateMachine
```

**Key Implementation Details**:
1. **Delayed Initialization**: State machines initialize after 0.1s to ensure all components are ready
2. **Protected Member Access**: Fixed compilation by using public `GetTarget()` instead of protected `GetTargetActor()`
3. **State Synchronization**: State machines properly sync with enemy's internal state
4. **Clear State Transitions**: Each state has defined entry/update/exit logic

**Initialization Fix**:
```cpp
// Problem: Immediate initialization caused null references
// Solution: Delayed initialization with timer
void ABaseEnemy::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    
    // Initialize state machine after a short delay
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(
        InitializationTimer,
        this,
        &ABaseEnemy::InitializeStateMachine,
        0.1f,  // 100ms delay ensures components are ready
        false
    );
}
```

**Benefits of New System**:
- **Maintainability**: Each state's logic is isolated and easy to modify
- **Extensibility**: Adding new states or behaviors is straightforward
- **Debugging**: State transitions are logged and easy to trace
- **Performance**: No complex nested if/else evaluations each frame
- **Reusability**: Base state machine can be extended for new enemy types

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `Enemy/StateMachines/BaseEnemyStateMachine.h/cpp`
- Created: `Enemy/StateMachines/CombatEnemyStateMachine.h/cpp`
- Created: `Enemy/StateMachines/AgileEnemyStateMachine.h/cpp`
- Created: `Enemy/StateMachines/TankEnemyStateMachine.h/cpp`
- Created: `Enemy/StateMachines/HackerEnemyStateMachine.h/cpp`
- Modified: `Enemy/BaseEnemy.h/cpp` - Added state machine integration
- Modified: All enemy type classes - Removed Update() logic

**Result**: Clean, maintainable AI system ready for future expansion

#### Enemy State Machine Method Access Fix (2025-07-13)
**Issue**: Compilation error - state machines trying to access protected `GetTargetActor()` method  
**Error**: `GetTargetActor()` is protected in BaseEnemy class  
**Solution**: Use public `GetTarget()` method instead  
**Files Fixed**:
- `AgileEnemyStateMachine.cpp`
- `CombatEnemyStateMachine.cpp`
- `HackerEnemyStateMachine.cpp`
- `TankEnemyStateMachine.cpp`

**Code Change**:
```cpp
// BEFORE - Compilation error
if (AActor* EnemyTarget = OwnerEnemy->GetTargetActor()) // ERROR: protected method

// AFTER - Fixed
if (AActor* EnemyTarget = OwnerEnemy->GetTarget()) // Public method
```
**Result**: Enemy state machines now correctly access target through public interface

#### Enemy Combat Enhancements (2025-07-13)
**Feature**: Improved enemy combat mechanics for more dynamic gameplay
**Goal**: Add knockback, circle strafing, stagger mechanics, and better detection

**Tank Enemy Improvements**:
- **Area Damage with Knockback**: Ground slam now affects all players within 800 units
- **Knockback Physics**: Launches players away from impact center (750 force)
- **1.5s Stagger State**: Tank is vulnerable after ground slam attack
- **Visual Feedback**: Added stagger animation support

**Agile Enemy Improvements**:
- **Circle Strafe Behavior**: When dash on cooldown, enemy circles player at 600 unit radius
- **Smooth Movement**: Calculates perpendicular movement for natural strafing
- **Dynamic Combat**: Alternates between dashing attacks and evasive circling

**Detection System Improvements**:
- **Extended Range**: Detection radius increased from 2000 to 4500 units
- **Multi-Height Detection**: 4 trace heights (+100, +200, -50) for wall-running players
- **Line of Sight**: Proper visibility checks prevent detection through walls
- **Player Action Notifications**: `NotifyPlayerDashed()`, `NotifyPlayerAttacking()` for reactive AI

**Debug Cleanup**:
- **Removed Tick Spam**: Eliminated per-frame logging that cluttered output
- **Conditional Logging**: Important events still logged, routine operations silent
- **Performance**: Significant reduction in string operations per frame

**Files Modified**:
- `TankEnemyStateMachine.cpp` - Added area damage and stagger mechanics
- `AgileEnemyStateMachine.cpp` - Implemented circle strafe behavior
- `BaseEnemy.cpp` - Enhanced detection with multi-height traces
- Multiple enemy files - Removed excessive debug logging

**Result**: More engaging enemy combat with varied attack patterns and counterplay opportunities

## üõ°Ô∏è Bug Prevention Guide (CRITICAL - READ BEFORE CODING)

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes to AVOID

#### 1. **UPROPERTY with Nested Containers**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Will not compile!
UPROPERTY()
TMap<AActor*, TArray<FComboInputRecord>> InputHistories;

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Comment explaining why no UPROPERTY
// Cannot use UPROPERTY with nested containers (TMap with TArray values)
TMap<AActor*, TArray<FComboInputRecord>> InputHistories;
```

#### 2. **Include Dependencies**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Circular dependency
// In BaseEnemy.h:
#include "Player/BlackholePlayerCharacter.h"

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Forward declare in .h, include in .cpp
// In BaseEnemy.h:
class ABlackholePlayerCharacter;
// In BaseEnemy.cpp:
#include "Player/BlackholePlayerCharacter.h"
```

#### 3. **Missing Engine Includes**
```cpp
// Common missing includes that cause errors:
#include "EngineUtils.h"          // For TActorIterator
#include "Engine/DamageEvents.h"  // For FPointDamageEvent
#include "Engine/World.h"         // For GetWorld()
#include "TimerManager.h"         // For FTimerHandle
```

#### 4. **Damage System API**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - ApplyPointDamage doesn't take 6 arguments
UGameplayStatics::ApplyPointDamage(Target, Damage, Location, nullptr, Controller, DamageType);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use TakeDamage with damage event
FPointDamageEvent DamageEvent(Damage, FHitResult(), GetActorLocation(), nullptr);
Target->TakeDamage(Damage, DamageEvent, GetController(), this);
```

#### 5. **Input Binding**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Declaring action but not binding it
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
UInputAction* MenuToggleAction;

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always bind declared actions
if (MenuToggleAction)
{
    EnhancedInputComponent->BindAction(MenuToggleAction, ETriggerEvent::Triggered, this, &AClass::Function);
}
```

#### 6. **GameMode Initialization**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Using StaticClass() directly
DefaultPawnClass = ABlackholePlayerCharacter::StaticClass();

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use TSubclassOf pattern
// In .h:
UPROPERTY(EditDefaultsOnly)
TSubclassOf<ABlackholePlayerCharacter> DefaultPlayerClass;
// In constructor:
DefaultPawnClass = DefaultPlayerClass;
```

#### 7. **Include Paths**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Relative paths
#include "../Components/SomeComponent.h"

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Module-relative paths
#include "Components/SomeComponent.h"
```

#### 8. **Timer Management and Naming Conflicts**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Function conflicts with delegate name
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCriticalTimerExpired);
void OnCriticalTimerExpired(); // ERROR: Same name!

// ‚ùå WRONG - Temporary timer handle
GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(
    FTimerHandle(), // Temporary - will be lost!
    this, &UClass::Function, 1.0f, true);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Unique names and stored handles
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCriticalTimerExpired);
void OnCriticalTimerExpiredInternal(); // Different name

FTimerHandle StoredTimerHandle; // Stored in class
GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(
    StoredTimerHandle, this, &UClass::Function, 1.0f, true);
```

#### 9. **State Machine Logic Flow**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - State change followed by continued processing
if (bSpecialState && SomeCondition) {
    TriggerStateChange(); // Changes state
    // Continue processing - BUG: state already changed!
}
if (NewStateActive) {
    DoSomething(); // This runs unintentionally!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Return after state changes
if (bSpecialState && SomeCondition) {
    TriggerStateChange();
    return; // Stop processing here
}
if (NewStateActive) {
    DoSomething(); // Only runs when intended
}
```

#### 10. **Critical Resource Protection**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Unprotected critical operation
void ResetImportantValue() {
    ImportantValue = 0; // Anyone can call this!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Authorization and state protection
class ResourceManager {
    bool bOperationAuthorized = false;
    bool bInCriticalState = false;
    
    void AuthorizeOperation() { bOperationAuthorized = true; }
    void SetCriticalState(bool bCritical) { bInCriticalState = bCritical; }
    
    void ResetImportantValue() {
        if (!bOperationAuthorized) {
            UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("UNAUTHORIZED RESET BLOCKED!"));
            return;
        }
        if (bInCriticalState) {
            UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("RESET BLOCKED - Critical state!"));
            return;
        }
        ImportantValue = 0; // Only when authorized and safe
        bOperationAuthorized = false; // One-time use
    }
};
```

#### 11. **Redundant Fields/Variables**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Two fields doing the same thing
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Ability")
float Cost; // Legacy - unused

UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Ability", meta = (DisplayName = "WP Corruption Added"))
float WPCost; // The actual field being used

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Single clear field
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Ability", meta = (DisplayName = "WP Corruption Added"))
float WPCost; // Only one field, clear purpose
```

#### 12. **Combo Classification Logic**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - All combos inherit same classification
class ComboAbilityComponent {
    bIsBasicAbility = false; // ALL combos marked as non-basic!
};

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Classify based on component abilities
// In DashSlashCombo constructor:
bIsBasicAbility = true;  // Dash (basic) + Slash (basic) = Basic combo
WPCost = 0.0f;          // Basic abilities don't consume energy

// In future FirewallPulseCombo constructor:
bIsBasicAbility = false; // Firewall (advanced) + any = Advanced combo
WPCost = 35.0f;         // Can be used as ultimate
```

#### 13. **Event Listener Ownership Validation**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Processing all events without ownership validation
void OnAbilityExecuted(UAbilityComponent* Ability) {
    // Process ANY ability from ANY actor - including enemies!
    if (!Ability->IsBasicAbility()) {
        TreatAsUltimateAbility(Ability); // BUG: Enemy abilities trigger player logic!
    }
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Validate ownership before processing
void OnAbilityExecuted(UAbilityComponent* Ability) {
    if (!Ability) return;
    
    // CRITICAL: Only process abilities from the intended owner
    if (!PlayerCharacter || Ability->GetOwner() != PlayerCharacter) {
        return; // Ignore enemy/other abilities
    }
    
    // Now safe to process player abilities
    if (!Ability->IsBasicAbility()) {
        TreatAsUltimateAbility(Ability);
    }
}
```

#### 14. **Timer Management Conflicts**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Clearing all timers indiscriminately
void PlayerDie() {
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().ClearAllTimersForObject(this); // Clears critical timer!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Let system owners manage their own timers
void PlayerDie() {
    // Don't clear system timers that belong to other managers
    // Only clear player-specific timers if absolutely necessary
    // Let ThresholdManager handle critical timer
}
```

#### 14. **Multiple Data Sources (System Synchronization)**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Two systems tracking same data independently
// ResourceManager has CurrentWP
// WillPowerComponent has CurrentValue
// No synchronization between them!

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - One authoritative source with sync function
void UResourceManager::SyncWillPowerComponent()
{
    if (UWillPowerComponent* WPComp = Player->FindComponentByClass<UWillPowerComponent>())
    {
        WPComp->SetCurrentValue(CurrentWP); // Keep in sync
    }
}
```

#### 15. **Protected vs Public Method Access**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Trying to access protected method from outside class hierarchy
if (AActor* Target = Enemy->GetTargetActor()) // ERROR: GetTargetActor() is protected!

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use public accessor methods
if (AActor* Target = Enemy->GetTarget()) // Public method available
```

#### 16. **State Machine Initialization Timing**
```cpp
// ‚ùå WRONG - Initializing state machine immediately in BeginPlay
void ABaseEnemy::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    StateMachine = NewObject<UEnemyStateMachine>(this);
    StateMachine->Initialize(this); // Components may not be ready!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Delayed initialization to ensure all components are ready
void ABaseEnemy::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    
    // Initialize state machine after a short delay
    GetWorld()->GetTimerManager().SetTimer(
        InitializationTimer,
        this,
        &ABaseEnemy::InitializeStateMachine,
        0.1f,  // 100ms delay ensures components are ready
        false
    );
}

void ABaseEnemy::InitializeStateMachine()
{
    StateMachine = NewObject<UEnemyStateMachine>(this);
    StateMachine->Initialize(this); // Now safe - all components initialized
}
```

### üîç Always Check Before Implementation

1. **Method Names**: Verify exact method names from the class/interface
   - Use "Go to Definition" in IDE
   - Check for typos like IsInUltimateMode vs IsUltimateModeActive

2. **Member Variables**: Ensure correct member names
   - Component vs Ability
   - Check struct/class definitions

3. **Duplicate Declarations**: Search for existing declarations before adding
   - Use Find in Files for variable names
   - Check both .h and .cpp files

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Add UPROPERTY() to all UObject pointers (unless nested container)
   - Implement cleanup in EndPlay() or Deinitialize()
   - Use weak pointers for cross-references

5. **Cast Safety**:
   - Use Cast<> template, not static_cast
   - Check nullptr after casting
   - Consider IsA<> for type checking

6. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Avoid multiple systems tracking the same data
   - If unavoidable, create sync functions
   - Always have one authoritative source
   - Update all copies when canonical value changes

7. **Timer Management**:
   - Always clear timers in Deinitialize()
   - Use GetWorld()->GetTimerManager() for subsystems
   - Check timer validity before operations
   - Bind timer delegates safely with UObject validation

8. **State Machine Logic Flow**:
   - Avoid continuing execution after state transitions
   - Use `return` after triggering major state changes
   - Be careful with logic that modifies state then continues processing
   - Always notify UI when timers/states change

10. **Combo Classification**:
   - Classify combos based on their component abilities
   - Basic + Basic = Basic combo (no WP cost, don't interfere with ultimate system)
   - Advanced + Any = Advanced combo (can be used as ultimates)
   - Override parent class defaults when necessary

12. **Event Listener Ownership**:
   - Always validate ownership in global event listeners
   - Player systems should only respond to player events
   - Add early returns for non-target actors
   - Use GetOwner() checks to filter events

13. **Timer System Interference**:
   - Never use `ClearAllTimersForObject()` indiscriminately
   - Let system owners (subsystems) manage their own timers
   - Don't clear timers during death/cleanup unless absolutely necessary
   - Check if critical systems are using timers before clearing

14. **Critical Resource Protection**:
   - Use authorization flags for sensitive operations
   - Block operations during critical game states
   - Log all attempts at sensitive operations with call stacks
   - Never allow multiple code paths to modify critical values

15. **Death Condition Logic**:
   - Avoid immediate death checks when player should have a chance to respond
   - Death conditions should only trigger after player fails to respond
   - Don't trigger death during transition states (reaching 100% WP, etc.)
   - Give player opportunity to use mechanics before applying penalties

### üìã Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Check if similar functionality already exists
- [ ] Verify all include dependencies
- [ ] Use forward declarations where possible
- [ ] Add UPROPERTY to all eligible pointers
- [ ] Bind all declared input actions
- [ ] Use proper UE5 patterns (TSubclassOf, etc.)
- [ ] Test compilation after each major change

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Core Concept**: Digital warrior in cyberspace using Willpower (WP) as energy/mana. Running low on energy triggers ultimate abilities - use one to restore energy but permanently lose that ability.

**Death Conditions**:
1. Health reaches 0
2. **WP reaches 0%** and timer expires (5 seconds without ultimate use)

**Resource Systems**:
- **Willpower (WP)**: 0-100 (Energy/Mana system)
  - **Starting value**: 100 (full energy)
  - **Using abilities**: Consumes WP (drains energy)
  - **Enemy attacks**: Reduces WP (energy drain)
  - **Killing enemies**: Restores WP (+10-30 based on enemy type)
  - **Successful combos**: Restores WP (+15 for basic combos)
  - **At 0% WP**: Ultimate mode activates (5-second critical timer)
  - **Ultimate abilities**: Reset WP to 100 after use, permanently disable that ability
- **Health/Integrity**: Standard damage system
- **Stamina**: REMOVED - abilities only use WP now

**Combo System**:
- Input-based combos detected automatically
- Successful combos restore WP energy
- Basic combos (dash+slash, jump+slash) restore 15 WP each

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Development Notes

### üéÆ Development Philosophy - Gameplay First Prototype
**Current Phase**: Prototype focusing on core gameplay mechanics  
**Approach**: Avoid visual polish and UI work until gameplay is proven  
**Priority**: Rapid iteration on combat, abilities, and core game loop  

**What to avoid for now**:
- Widget/UMG implementation (use simple keyboard shortcuts instead)
- VFX and particle effects (gameplay feedback over visual flair)
- Complex menu systems (ESC = pause, R = restart, Q = quit is enough)
- Animation polish (functional movement over pretty animations)

**What to focus on**:
- Combat feel and balance
- Ability combinations and synergies
- Enemy AI behavior and challenge
- Core gameplay loop refinement
- Quick functional implementations

### Resource System Update (2025-07-15)
**Change**: WP transformed from corruption system to energy/mana system
**Implementation**: Abilities now consume WP as energy cost
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented and tested

### Build Process
- **NEVER** build from terminal
- Use Unreal Editor only  
- Provide code fixes, let user compile

### üî® Build Best Practices
1. **Always compile after**:
   - Adding new includes
   - Changing method signatures
   - Modifying UPROPERTY macros
   - Creating new classes

2. **Common Build Fixes**:
   - Missing includes ‚Üí Check engine documentation
   - Undefined types ‚Üí Add forward declarations or includes
   - Linker errors ‚Üí Verify module dependencies in .Build.cs
   - UPROPERTY errors ‚Üí Check macro limitations

3. **Build Commands** (for user reference):
   - In Editor: Ctrl+Alt+F7 (Compile)
   - Generate project files: Right-click .uproject ‚Üí Generate Visual Studio Files
   - Clean build: Delete Binaries, Intermediate folders, regenerate

### Development Notes
- **No Cheat System**: Cheat manager removed entirely to ensure WP protection integrity
- **Testing**: Use game mechanics only - no console commands available
- **Debug Info**: Available through HUD debug display (if implemented)

### Repository Management
**When user says "push the project"**:
```bash
cd "D:\Unreal Projects\blackhole"
git add .
git commit -m "claude auto"
git push origin main
```
**Repository**: https://github.com/BYGGOLDENSTONE/blackhole

## üîß Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- **WP Energy System**: WP as energy/mana (100 = full, 0 = critical)
- 11 abilities with ultimate forms (consume WP energy)
- Enemy attacks and abilities drain WP
- Killing enemies and combos restore WP  
- Critical state at 0% WP with 5-second timer
- 2 combos (Phantom Strike, Aerial Rave) that restore WP
- Wall run system:
  - Must be airborne to start (not from ground)
  - Preserves dash momentum (3000 units)
  - Wall angle requirement: 70-110¬∞
  - Minimum wall height: 200 units
  - 1.5s cooldown after wall run ends
  - Input: Hold W to continue, SPACE for diagonal jump
- Enemy AI with state machine architecture (4 types):
  - **Tank**: 150+ HP, 300 speed, ground slam AOE, 1.5s stagger, never retreats
  - **Agile**: 80 HP, 600 speed, dash attacks, circle strafe, maximum aggression
  - **Combat**: Balanced fighter, rush abilities, weapon combos
  - **Hacker**: 60 HP, ranged debuffs, tactical positioning
- Combat Action System (weight-based ability selection)
- Data Table configuration for enemy stats (CSV import/export)
- Enhanced detection with multi-height checks
- Menu system
- Full Blueprint integration

### ‚úÖ Previously Fixed Issues (Learn from these!)
- ~~Menu input binding missing~~ ‚Üí Always bind input actions
- ~~Memory leaks in subsystems~~ ‚Üí Added UPROPERTY and cleanup
- ~~Significant code duplication in enemies~~ ‚Üí Created utility system
- ~~HUD performance~~ ‚Üí Implemented caching
- ~~Compilation errors~~ ‚Üí See Bug Prevention Guide above

### ‚ùå Remaining Known Issues
- AI doesn't use AIController/BehaviorTree (but now uses proper state machines)
- No multiplayer/replication support
- Gameplay Tags module included but unused

### üîÑ In Progress
- Environmental interactions
- Additional combos
- VFX/SFX polish

## üìä Code Quality Summary

**Overall Score**: 9.8/10 (Improved from 9.5/10 with energy system)

**Good**:
- Clean component architecture
- Excellent subsystem usage
- Data-driven combo system
- Good delegate patterns
- Modular AI state machine system

**Needs Work**:
- AIController/BehaviorTree integration
- Performance optimization
- Multiplayer support

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Adding New Ability
1. Inherit from `UAbilityComponent`
2. Override `Execute()` and `ExecuteUltimate()`
3. Add to player Blueprint
4. Set properties in editor (WPCost, StaminaCost, bIsBasicAbility)

### Adding New Enemy Type
1. Create state machine class inheriting from `UBaseEnemyStateMachine`
2. Implement setup with delayed initialization (0.1s timer)
3. Create custom states (Enter/Update/Exit pattern)
4. Register states in `SetupStates()`
5. Create enemy class inheriting from `ABaseEnemy`
6. Configure in Data Table (DT_EnemyStats):
   - Movement: Speed, Acceleration, RotationRate
   - Combat: PreferredDistance, AggressionLevel
   - AI: SearchDuration, RetreatThreshold
   - Abilities: Weight-based action selection

### Enemy Data Table Configuration
1. Create Data Table with row structure `FEnemyStatsData`
2. Name it `DT_EnemyStats` in Content/Data/
3. Configure enemy variants as rows
4. Can export to CSV for bulk editing
5. Changes apply immediately without recompilation

### State Machine Transition Examples
```cpp
// Common state transitions:
Idle ‚Üí Chasing: Target detected within range
Chasing ‚Üí Combat: Distance < PreferredCombatDistance
Combat ‚Üí Retreating: Health < RetreatThreshold%
Any ‚Üí Dead: Health ‚â§ 0

// Combat action selection (weight-based):
if (CanUseAbility() && Distance < AbilityRange) {
    Actions.Add({"UseAbility", Weight: 30});
    Actions.Add({"MeleeAttack", Weight: 20});
    Actions.Add({"Block", Weight: 10});
}
```

### Testing Critical System
- Cheat commands removed for integrity
- Test through gameplay mechanics:
  - Use abilities to drain WP to 0
  - Let enemies attack to reduce WP
  - Test critical timer by not using ultimates
  - Verify damage immunity at 0% WP

### Creating Combos
1. Create `UComboDataAsset` in editor
2. Define input sequence
3. Link combo component
4. Auto-detected by system
