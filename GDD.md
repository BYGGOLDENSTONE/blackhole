## üéÆ Game Overview

### Core Concept
A high-intensity action game where players embody a digital warrior navigating cyberspace through precise combat and ability management. Master the corruption system where power comes at the cost of stability.

### Core Pillars
1. **Risk/Reward Combat**: Balance aggressive ability use with corruption buildup
2. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Ability loss creates escalating challenge with compensatory buffs
3. **Precision Gameplay**: Combo system rewards timing and skill
4. **Strategic Sacrifice**: Choose which abilities to lose when pushed to the limit
5. **Fluid Movement**: Wall running and advanced traversal enable cyberpunk mobility

## ‚ö° Resource System

### Energy System Design
**REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE**: WP is now an energy/mana system with unique ultimate mechanics

| Resource | Start | Max | Mechanic |
|----------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Willpower (WP)** | 100 | 100 | Energy for abilities and health |
| **Stamina** | - | - | Removed from the game |

### WP Mechanics
- **Taking Damage**: Reduces WP (drains energy)
- **Using Abilities**: Consumes WP (energy cost)
- **Killing Enemies**: Restores WP based on enemy type
- **Combos**: Restore WP (Dash+Slash: +15, Jump+Slash: +15, Dash+WallRun: +10)
- **At 0 WP**: Ultimate mode activates (no death)
- **Ultimate Reset**: Using ultimate ability resets WP to 100 (full energy)

### Resource Interactions
- **Abilities**: Consume WP as energy cost
- **Basic Abilities**: Always available (still cost WP)
- **Enemy Mindmeld**: Drains 1.0 WP/sec while maintaining line of sight
- **Combo Rewards**: Restore WP on successful execution

## üéØ Hacker Path Mechanics

### Theme & Identity
- **Core**: Speed, precision, technical mastery
- **Visual**: Cyan/blue digital effects, glitch aesthetics
- **Audio**: Electronic, synthetic, cyberpunk soundscape
- **Playstyle**: Hit-and-run tactics, ability combos, environmental manipulation

### Willpower (WP) Thresholds
| WP Range | State | Effects |
|----------|-------|---------|
| 0% | Ultimate Mode | Critical timer (5s) + All abilities become ultimates |
| 1-20% | Critical Low | Low energy warning |
| 20-50% | Warning | Reduced buffs |
| 50-100% | Healthy | +20% damage, -15% cooldowns, +25% attack speed |

### Critical State System
- **Entries**: Players have 3 critical state entries by default
- **Usage**: Each 0% WP consumes one entry
- **Timer Expires**: 
  - With entries: WP restored to 100%
  - No entries: Instant death
- **Future**: Collectibles can increase entry limit

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System

### Basic Abilities (Always Available)
| Ability | Key | WP Cost | Effect |
|---------|-----|---------|--------|
| **Katana Slash** | LMB | 0 | Quick 3-hit combo, 20 base damage, dual detection (trace + sphere) |
| **Hacker Dash** | Shift | 0 | Movement input directional dash with i-frames |
| **Hacker Jump** | Space | 0 | Double jump with 0.5s cooldown |

### Advanced Movement System

#### Wall Running
The wall run system enables fluid cyberpunk traversal through vertical environments:

**Activation Requirements:**
- Player must be **airborne** (jumping, falling, or dashing)
- Wall must be within 45 units and roughly vertical (70-110¬∞ angle)
- Minimum wall height of 200 units
- Minimum height from ground: 150 units (prevents accidental wall runs)
- Player must be **looking at the wall** (40% dot product minimum) for intentional activation

**Mechanics:**
- **Speed Cap**: Dash speed (3000 units) capped at 1000 units/s during wall run
- **Height Maintenance**: Player runs at consistent height along wall surface  
- **Input Control**: W key required to continue wall running (any direction)
- **Duration**: Unlimited as long as W is held and wall exists
- **Camera Freedom**: Full 360¬∞ camera control while wall running for combat
- **Movement Lock**: Character follows wall path regardless of camera direction
- **Camera Effects**: Dynamic camera tilt based on wall side (¬±20¬∞)

**Wall Jump System:**
- **Activation**: SPACE key during wall run triggers diagonal wall jump
- **Direction**: Launches diagonally away from wall (up + left/right)
- **Launch Force**: 550 units with reliable physics using Launch() method
- **Cooldown**: 1.5s cooldown prevents immediate wall re-attachment

**Safety Systems:**
- **Wall Verification**: Automatic detection every second prevents "air running"
- **Ability Restrictions**: Blocks dash and regular jump during wall run
- **Advanced Abilities**: Combat abilities remain available during wall run
- **Auto-End**: Wall run ends automatically when wall geometry ends

**Integration:**
- Works seamlessly with existing dash and jump abilities
- Preserves momentum for chaining movement techniques
- Visual feedback through UI messages and particle effects
- Debug visualization available for level designers

### Combat Abilities
| Ability | Key | WP Cost | Cooldown | Effect |
|---------|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| **Firewall Breach** | RMB | 15 | 4s | Mark enemy for +30% damage |
| **Pulse Hack** | Q | 20 | 6s | AoE slow (50%) for 3s |
| **Gravity Pull** | E | 15 | 5s | Pull enemies (1000 range) |
| **Data Spike** | R | 25 | 4s | High damage projectile |
| **System Override** | F | 30 | 90s | AoE stun |

### Combo System
| Combo | Input | Window | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Phantom Strike** | Dash ‚Üí Slash | 0.5s | Teleport backstab (2x damage) |
| **Aerial Rave** | Jump ‚Üí Slash | 0.3s | Ground slam with shockwave |

> **Note**: Additional combos (Tempest Blade, Blade Dance) planned for future updates

## üíÄ Ultimate System

### Ultimate Mode (0% WP)
When WP reaches 0%, the player enters Ultimate Mode:
1. **Critical Timer Starts**: 5 seconds to act
2. All non-basic abilities become ultimate versions
3. Player must use ONE ultimate ability before timer expires
4. The used ability is permanently disabled
5. WP resets to 100% after use (full energy)
6. If timer expires: Death
7. Process repeats - each energy depletion trades power for sacrifice

### Death Conditions
1. **All Abilities Disabled**: Death when no abilities remain (implementation pending)
2. **Enemy Pressure**: Mindmeld continuously drains WP

### Strategic Choices
- Which abilities to sacrifice?
- When to use ultimates?
- Risk immediate power vs long-term survival

```

## üéØ Status Effect System

### StatusEffectComponent
A centralized system for managing all actor states:

**Supported Effects:**
- **Stagger**: Disables movement and actions, slows animations
- **Stun**: Complete incapacitation

**Features:**
- Effect stacking with configurable limits
- Duration management with automatic cleanup
- Magnitude support for variable strength effects
- Event broadcasting for UI/VFX reactions
- Immunity system for special enemies/bosses

## üîÆ Upcoming Feature Implementations

### 1. Critical State Limit System
**Lives/Retry Mechanic**
- Players have limited "critical state entries" (default: 3 per level)
- Each time WP reaches 0%, one entry is consumed
- If timer expires without ultimate use:
  - Entries remaining: WP restored to 100% (full energy)
  - No entries left: Instant death
- When entries exceed limit, 0% WP = instant death (no timer)

**Progression Integration**
- Collectible items increase critical state limit
- Equipment upgrades grant additional entries
- Creates strategic resource management layer
- Encourages exploration and careful play

### 3. Slash Ability Targeting Enhancement
**Current Issue**: Trace from camera to crosshair often misses enemies positioned below/above crosshair

**New Implementation**:
1. **Extended Trace**: Camera ray extends 2x beyond crosshair distance
2. **Sphere Check**: 300-unit radius sphere around player for melee range
3. **Dual Validation**: Enemy must be hit by BOTH trace AND sphere
4. **Result**: More forgiving targeting while maintaining skill requirement

### 4. Enemy System Expansion
**Implemented Enemy Types** ‚úÖ:
- **Tank Unit**: Heat aura + charge ability
