**Version**: 3.1  
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.5  
**Language**: C++ with Blueprint integration  
**Date**: 2025-07-08

> **üìö Note**: For detailed ability information, see [ABILITIES_DOCUMENTATION.md](ABILITIES_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## üéÆ Game Overview

### Core Concept
A tactical action game where players embody a hybrid hacker-forge warrior, choosing between two distinct paths before each level. Navigate dangerous environments through close combat and environmental manipulation while managing unique resource systems.

### Core Pillars
1. **Dual Path System**: Pre-level choice between Hacker (speed/precision) and Forge (power/destruction)
2. **Resource Risk/Reward**: Balance aggression with conservation through WP corruption or Heat buildup
3. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Ability loss creates escalating challenge with compensatory buffs
4. **Environmental Mastery**: Interact with world objects differently based on chosen path

## ‚ö° Resource System

### Primary Resources
| Resource | Path | Start | Max | Mechanic |
|----------|------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Stamina** | Both | 100 | 100 | Universal resource, 10/sec regen |
| **Willpower** | Hacker | 0% | 100% | Corruption increases with ability use (bad) |
| **Heat** | Forge | 0 | 100 | Combat abilities only, 5/sec dissipation |

### Resource Interactions
- **Hacker**: Abilities cost Stamina + ADD WP corruption
- **Forge**: Combat abilities cost Stamina + Heat (utility uses stamina only)
- **Enemy Mindmeld**: Adds 1.0 WP/sec while maintaining line of sight
- **Combo Rewards**: Reduce WP by 2-10 or Heat by 3 based on chain length

## üîÄ Path System

### Hacker Path
- **Theme**: Speed, precision, technical mastery
- **Visual**: Cyan/blue effects
- **Playstyle**: Hit-and-run, environmental manipulation, ability combos
- **Risk**: WP corruption leads to ability loss

### Forge Path  
- **Theme**: Power, impact, destructive force
- **Visual**: Red/orange effects
- **Playstyle**: Tank through damage, area control, burst damage
- **Risk**: Heat overload causes temporary lockout

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Abilities

### Hacker Abilities
| Ability | Key | Stamina | WP | Cooldown | Effect |
|---------|-----|---------|-----|----------|---------|
| **Katana Slash** | LMB | 10 | +15 | 2s | Quick strike with bleed DoT |
| **Firewall Breach** | RMB | 15 | +20 | 4s | 30% armor reduction for 5s |
| **Pulse Hack** | Q | 5 | +10 | 8s | AoE slow + cleanses 5 WP per enemy |
| **Gravity Pull** | E | 10 | +15 | 3s | Pull enemies/objects (2000 unit range) |
| **[Data Spike]** | R | - | - | - | *To be implemented* |
| **[System Override]** | F | - | - | - | *Ultimate - To be implemented* |

### Forge Abilities
| Ability | Key | Stamina | Heat | Cooldown | Effect |
|---------|-----|---------|------|----------|---------|
| **[Forge Slam]** | LMB | 15 | 20 | 2s | *Heavy ground strike - To be implemented* |
| **Molten Mace** | RMB | 20 | 30 | 5s | Cone attack with burn DoT |
| **Heat Shield** | Q | 15 | 20 | 12s | 100 HP absorption barrier |
| **Blast Charge** | E | 20 | 25 | 10s | Explosion with knockback |
| **Hammer Strike** | R | 15 | 20 | 6s | 3-hit stun combo |
| **[Volcanic Eruption]** | F | - | - | - | *Ultimate - To be implemented* |

### Utility Abilities
| Path | Dash (Shift) | Jump (Space) |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Hacker** | 5 Stamina, 1000 units, i-frames | 10 Stamina, double jump (0.5s cooldown between jumps) |
| **Forge** | 5 Stamina, damages on impact | 10 Stamina, ground slam on landing |

## üéØ Ability Loss System

### WP System (Hacker Path)
| WP Range | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 0-50% | Normal state - all abilities available |
| 50-99% | Buffed state - +20% damage, +15% cooldown reduction, +25% attack speed |
| 100% | **ULTIMATE MODE** - All abilities become ultimate versions |

**Ultimate Mode Mechanics**:
- When WP reaches 100%, non-basic abilities transform into powerful ultimate versions
- Basic abilities (Slash, Jump, Dash) remain normal and cannot be sacrificed
- Player can use ONE ultimate ability (from non-basic abilities)
- The ability used is permanently disabled for that combat
- WP resets to 0 after ultimate use
- Process can repeat until death conditions are met

**Death Conditions**:
- **Integrity reaches 0**: Standard combat death from damage
- **After losing 3 abilities**: If WP reaches 100% again ‚Üí instant death
- **4th time reaching 100% WP**: Death (regardless of abilities lost)

### Ultimate Abilities (100% WP)
**Hacker Ultimate Abilities** (Non-Basic Only):
- **System Overload** (Pulse Hack): Screen-wide stun, cleanses 50 WP
- **Singularity** (Gravity Pull): Black hole pulls all enemies to center
- **Total System Compromise** (Firewall Breach): 100% armor removal on all enemies

**Basic Abilities** (Not Ultimate):
- **Slash**: Maintains normal function, only receives 50% WP buffs
- **Jump**: Maintains normal function, always available for mobility
- **Dash**: Maintains normal function, always available for repositioning

**Player Choice**: Use one ultimate ability, lose it permanently, reset to 0 WP

**Heat at 100% (Forge)**:
- *Meltdown*: AoE explosion dealing 50 damage to all nearby
- 5-second ability lockout (current implementation)
- Visible heat distortion effects
- Emergency vent animation

## üåç Environmental Interactions

### Hacker Interactions
| Object Type | Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Data Terminals** | Hack (2s channel) | Reveal enemy positions, disable security |
| **Corrupted Nodes** | Cleanse (E ability) | -20 WP, creates safe zone |
| **Energy Barriers** | Bypass | Phase through for 3 seconds |
| **Turrets** | Override | Turn against enemies for 10s |

### Forge Interactions
| Object Type | Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Metal Barriers** | Melt (3s channel) | Create new pathways |
| **Scrap Piles** | Forge | Craft temporary weapon upgrades |
| **Heat Vents** | Activate | -30 Heat instantly |
| **Destructibles** | Smash | Area damage + resource drops |

### Shared Interactions
- **Resource Stations**: Restore 25 Stamina
- **Combo Shrines**: Next combo grants double rewards
- **Path Beacons**: Preview path-specific routes

## üëæ Enemy Design

### Enemy Types
| Type | Health | Behavior | Special Ability |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Hacker Scout** | 50 | Maintains distance | Mindmeld (1 WP/sec) |
| **Forge Brute** | 150 | Aggressive melee | Smash (40 damage + stun) |
| **Agile Assassin** | 75 | Hit and run | 30% dodge chance |
| **Tank Guardian** | 200 | Defensive | 50% damage reduction when blocking |
| **Hybrid Elite** | 100 | Adaptive AI | Switches tactics based on player path |

### AI Behaviors
- **Path Awareness**: Enemies adapt tactics to player's chosen path
- **Environmental Usage**: Use cover, activate traps, call reinforcements
- **Coordination**: Flanking maneuvers, combo attacks
- **Retreat Mechanics**: Low health enemies seek cover/healing

## üìù Design Notes

### Critical Decisions
1. **No Path Switching**: Commitment creates meaningful choice
2. **Corruption vs Heat**: Different risk profiles for variety
3. **Ability Loss**: Creates dynamic difficulty within combat
4. **Environmental Focus**: Rewards exploration and creativity

### Open Questions
1. Should ultimate abilities have unique threshold interactions?
2. How do environmental interactions scale with player progression?
3. Should there be permanent upgrades between runs?
4. What happens when both paths are mastered - hybrid mode?
