BLACKHOLE - ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTION SYSTEM PLAN
=================================================
Date: 2025-07-06
Engine: Unreal Engine 5.5

This document outlines planned environmental interactions for the dual-path (Hacker/Forge) gameplay system.

=================================================
1. CORE INTERACTABLE OBJECTS (Start Here)
=================================================

EXPLOSIVE BARRELS (Works for both paths)
- Hacker: Gravity Pull to launch at enemies, hack to delay explosion
- Forge: Molten Mace ignites instantly, Blast Charge for chain reactions
- Gameplay: Strategic positioning, combo potential

ENERGY CORES (Dual-purpose objects)
- Hacker: Hack to overload and create EMP burst (disables enemy shields)
- Forge: Heat Shield absorbs core energy for extended duration
- Placement: Near tough enemy encounters

PHYSICS CRATES/DEBRIS
- Primary targets for Gravity Pull
- Different weights = different pull speeds
- Can be used as improvised shields or weapons

=================================================
2. HACKER-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS
=================================================

SECURITY TURRETS
- Hack with Firewall Breach to turn against enemies
- Limited ammo/duration to maintain balance
- Visual: Changes from red to blue when hacked

DATA TERMINALS
- Pulse Hack near terminals = area buff (reduced ability cooldowns)
- Creates "safe zones" where WP corruption decreases slowly
- Encourages exploration

ELECTRONIC BARRIERS
- Hack to disable for 10 seconds
- Creates alternate routes only Hackers can access
- Can trap enemies by re-enabling

DRONE DISPENSERS
- Hack to spawn ally drones for 30 seconds
- Drones distract enemies, allowing flanking

=================================================
3. FORGE-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS
=================================================

MOLTEN METAL FLOWS
- Hammer Strike on valves redirects flow
- Creates damage zones for area denial
- Heat Shield lets you walk through safely

FORGE STATIONS
- Blast Charge activates temporary weapon upgrades
- Next 3 Molten Mace attacks have increased range
- Visual feedback: Weapon glows brighter

DESTRUCTIBLE WALLS
- Only Forge abilities can break through
- Reveals shortcuts or hidden resources
- Different health levels for variety

HEAT CONDUCTORS
- Metal pillars that spread heat damage
- Molten Mace on one end damages all enemies touching connected metal
- Environmental combo potential

=================================================
4. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STATIONS
=================================================

WP CLEANSING PODS (Hacker healing)
- Reduce WP corruption by 30%
- 60-second cooldown per use
- Vulnerable while using (3-second channel)
- Placement: After challenging encounters

HEAT DISSIPATION VENTS (Forge cooling)
- Instant heat reduction to 50%
- Can "overcharge" to reduce heat below normal for 10 seconds
- Steam visual effect obscures vision briefly

HYBRID ENERGY WELLS
- Player must choose: Cleanse WP OR Cool Heat
- Can't use both effects
- Forces tactical decisions

=================================================
5. INTERACTIVE COMBAT ELEMENTS
=================================================

GRAVITY ANCHORS
- Fixed points that Gravity Pull can latch onto
- Pull yourself for rapid repositioning
- Or pull anchor to crush nearby enemies

HACKABLE/FORGEABLE PLATFORMS
- Hacker: Hack to move platforms electrically
- Forge: Hammer Strike to manually rotate/flip
- Creates verticality in combat

ENVIRONMENTAL TRAPS
- Electric Grids: Hackable on/off states
- Furnace Rooms: Forge Dash through safely, enemies take damage
- Cryo Pipes: Break for area slow (helps both paths)

=================================================
6. PUZZLE INTEGRATION
=================================================

POWER REDISTRIBUTION
- Hack multiple nodes to redirect power
- Opens doors, activates elevators
- Requires tactical ability use

WEIGHT-ACTIVATED SWITCHES
- Use Gravity Pull to move heavy objects
- Some require multiple objects (co-op potential)
- Can use enemies as weights!

TEMPERATURE PUZZLES
- Forge heats elements, Hacker cools with hacked cryo systems
- Both paths can solve differently

=================================================
7. DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
=================================================

CORRUPTION ZONES
- Areas that slowly add WP to all characters
- Hacker enemies are immune, forcing quick combat
- Pulse Hack temporarily clears a safe bubble

OVERHEAT CHAMBERS
- Constantly add heat in Forge path
- Must quickly navigate or find cooling stations
- Heat Shield provides temporary immunity

UNSTABLE PLATFORMS
- Collapse after taking damage
- Can be triggered by abilities for tactical advantage
- Regenerate after 30 seconds

=================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
=================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Implement First):
1. HackableObject Component - Base system for all interactions
2. Explosive Barrels - Immediate fun, works with Gravity Pull
3. WP/Heat Stations - Essential for resource management gameplay

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
4. Security Turrets - Adds tactical depth
5. Destructible Walls - Environmental variety
6. Gravity Anchors - Movement options

LOW PRIORITY:
7. Puzzle Systems - After core combat is polished
8. Dynamic Hazards - Late-game variety

=================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
=================================================

BASE CLASSES NEEDED:
- AHackableObject: Base actor with HackableComponent
- AForgeableObject: Base actor for Forge interactions
- AResourceStation: Base for WP/Heat management stations
- AEnvironmentalHazard: Base for damage zones

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
- UHackableComponent: Already exists, extend functionality
- UForgeableComponent: New component for Forge interactions
- UInteractableComponent: Generic interaction handler

VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEMS:
- Outline shader for targetable objects
- Color coding: Blue (Hacker), Orange (Forge), Purple (Both)
- Particle effects for state changes
- UI prompts for interaction availability
