# Improvement Report - 2025-07-17 (Complete Session)

## Session Overview
Major improvements to core game systems including StatusEffectComponent enhancements, enemy AI behavior revolution, PsiDisruptor building mechanics, and automatic door system implementation. This was an extensive session that touched nearly every major system in the game.

## Part 1: StatusEffectComponent Enhancements

### 1. Source Tracking System
**Problem**: No way to track who applied effects or clean up when source is destroyed
**Solution**: Added source tracking to FStatusEffect struct
- Added `TWeakObjectPtr<AActor> Source` to track effect applicator
- Added `RemoveEffectsFromSource()` for cleanup when source dies
- Updated `ApplyStatusEffect()` to accept optional source parameter
- Files: `StatusEffectComponent.h/cpp`

### 2. Priority System
**Problem**: Conflicting effects could override important ones
**Solution**: Implemented priority-based effect application
- Added `int32 Priority` to FStatusEffect
- Higher priority effects block lower priority ones
- Useful for boss abilities that shouldn't be interrupted
- Default priority is 0 for backward compatibility

### 3. Stacking Rules
**Problem**: All effects behaved the same when reapplied
**Solution**: Per-effect type stacking behaviors
- Added `EEffectStackingRule` enum
- Implemented `GetStackingRule()` with rules per effect type:
  - Stagger/Stun: Refresh duration
  - Slow/SpeedBoost: Replace with new value
  - Burn/DamageBoost: Stack up to max
  - Shield: Extend duration
  - Freeze/Knockdown/Dead: Ignore duplicates

### 4. Movement System Integration
**Problem**: Movement didn't respect status effects consistently
**Solution**: Added CanMove() checks
- Updated `Move()` to check StatusEffectComponent
- Updated `UseUtilityJump()` to check before jumping
- Updated `UseDash()` to check before dashing
- Files: `BlackholePlayerCharacter.cpp`

### 5. Ability System Integration
**Problem**: Abilities could be used while stunned/staggered
**Solution**: Added CanAct() check to AbilityComponent
- Checks StatusEffectComponent for both players and enemies
- Prevents ability use during stagger, stun, or death
- Early exit for better performance
- Files: `AbilityComponent.cpp`

## Part 2: Enemy AI Enhancements

### 1. Standard Enemy Building Behavior
- **Added**: Build PsiDisruptor after 6 seconds without hitting player
- **Tracks**: Time since last successful hit
- **Forces**: Player engagement to prevent area denial

### 2. PsiDisruptor Invulnerability
- **Changed**: Immune to all damage except Singularity ability
- **Requires**: Ultimate Gravity Pull to destroy
- **Creates**: Strategic ultimate usage decisions

### 3. Building Interruption
- **Monitors**: Builder status during construction
- **Cancels**: Build if insufficient builders remain
- **Rewards**: Aggressive play against builders

### 4. MindMelder PowerfulMindmeld
- **Fixed**: Line of sight check logic
- **Reduced**: Cooldown from 60s to 45s
- **Removed**: Time delay requirement
- **Result**: Properly executes 30s channel to drop player WP to 0

## Part 3: PsiDisruptor Building System Enhancement

### Visual Build Sphere
- Created translucent sphere mesh showing build area
- Builders must stay within sphere to continue building
- Sphere persists even when builders die

### Timer Mechanics
- Build time doubles when builders are killed (1.5x multiplier per death)
- Building pauses (not cancels) when all builders die
- Resumes when new builders enter sphere

### State Management
- Created new `StandardBuildingState` for builders
- Prevents combat/chase behavior while building
- Builders return to sphere if they drift too far

### Files Modified
- `BuilderComponent.h/cpp` - Core building logic
- `StandardBuildingState.h/cpp` - New state (created)
- `StandardCombatState.cpp` - Fixed controller cast
- `StandardChaseState.cpp` - Added 4s timeout for building

## Part 4: Automatic Door System

### Detection System
- Proximity trigger (400 unit range)
- Look-at requirement (player must face door)
- Separate inside trigger for auto-close

### Movement
- Smooth interpolation up/down
- Configurable height (default 600 units)
- State machine (Closed/Opening/Open/Closing)

### Smart Behavior
- Opens only when player is near AND looking
- Closes immediately when player exits
- Won't close if player is inside

### Files Created
- `AutomaticDoor.h/cpp` - Complete door implementation
- `AUTOMATIC_DOOR_GUIDE.md` - Usage documentation

## Part 5: Walk/Run System (Implemented then Removed)

### Initial Implementation
- Walk speed 300, run speed 600
- Double-tap W within 1 second to run
- Complex state tracking system

### Issues Encountered
- False positive running on first press
- Double-tap not working after restart
- Inconsistent behavior

### Resolution
- User requested complete removal
- Restored original movement (600 speed)
- Cleaned up all related code
- Files Modified: `BlackholePlayerCharacter.h/cpp`

## Critical Fixes

### Compilation Error Fixes
- **GetAIController Error**: Changed to `Cast<AAIController>(Enemy->GetController())`
- **Variable Shadowing**: Renamed local variables to avoid member conflicts
- **Multiple Files**: StandardCombatState, StandardBuildingState, PowerfulMindmeldComponent

### MindMelder PowerfulMindmeld Fix
- **Problem**: Wasn't properly draining player WP to 0
- **Fix**: Use ResourceManager SetCurrentValue(0)
- **Result**: Properly triggers critical timer as intended

### Debug Visualization Cleanup
- **Removed**: Debug line traces from door look detection
- **Kept**: Debug boxes for door proximity (editor only)

## Code Quality Improvements

### Better Encapsulation
- All state queries go through StatusEffectComponent
- No duplicate state tracking in other components
- Clear separation of concerns

### Improved API
```cpp
// Old way (no tracking)
ApplyStatusEffect(Type, Duration, Magnitude);

// New way (with tracking and priority)
ApplyStatusEffect(Type, Duration, Magnitude, bAllowStacking, Source, Priority);
```

### Safety Features
- Weak pointers prevent dangling references
- Priority system prevents accidental overrides
- Stacking rules prevent effect spam

### Better State Management
```cpp
// Building state prevents other behaviors
void UStandardBuildingState::Enter(ABaseEnemy* Enemy)
{
    // Stop all movement
    if (AAIController* AIController = Cast<AAIController>(Enemy->GetController()))
    {
        AIController->StopMovement();
    }
}
```

### Proper Timer Handling
```cpp
// Dynamic timer adjustment based on builder deaths
float TimeRemaining = CurrentBuildTime - TimeSpentBuilding;
int32 BuildersKilled = InitialBuilderCount - ParticipatingBuilders.Num();
float NewTimeRemaining = TimeRemaining * FMath::Pow(1.5f, BuildersKilled);
```

## Testing and Validation

### Compilation
- All code compiles without errors
- No warnings introduced
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Integration Points
- Movement properly blocked during stagger/stun
- Abilities respect status effects
- Source tracking works with weak pointers

### Feature Testing
