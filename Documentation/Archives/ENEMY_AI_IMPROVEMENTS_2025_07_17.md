# Enemy AI Improvements Report - 2025-07-17

## Overview
Enhanced enemy AI behaviors to create more challenging and dynamic encounters. Standard enemies now proactively build PsiDisruptors, PsiDisruptors require specific abilities to destroy, and MindMelder enemies properly execute their powerful abilities.

## Major Improvements

### 1. Standard Enemy Building Behavior
**Problem**: Standard enemies only built PsiDisruptors while actively attacking
**Solution**: Added timer-based building trigger when unable to hit player

#### Implementation:
- Added `TimeSinceLastHit` tracking in `StandardCombatState`
- Builds PsiDisruptor after 6 seconds without hitting player
- Resets timer when attack is in range (likely to hit)
- Files: `StandardCombatState.h/cpp`

```cpp
// New behavior in StandardCombatState::Update()
if (TimeSinceLastHit >= NoHitBuildThreshold) // 6 seconds
{
    CheckBuildingOpportunity(Enemy);
    TimeSinceLastHit = 0.0f;
}
```

### 2. PsiDisruptor Invulnerability
**Problem**: PsiDisruptors could be destroyed by any damage
**Solution**: Made them immune to all damage except Singularity (Gravity Pull Ultimate)

#### Changes:
- `APsiDisruptor::TakeDamage()` now returns 0 damage
- Added detection in `GravityPullAbilityComponent::ExecuteUltimate()`
- Singularity specifically destroys PsiDisruptors via `DestroyByUltimate()`
- Files: `PsiDisruptor.cpp`, `GravityPullAbilityComponent.cpp`

```cpp
// PsiDisruptor is now invulnerable
float APsiDisruptor::TakeDamage(...)
{
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Psi-Disruptor is immune to normal damage! Use Singularity..."));
    return 0.0f;
}
```

### 3. Building Process Interruption
**Problem**: Building continued even when builders were killed
**Solution**: Active monitoring of builder status during build

#### Implementation:
- `UpdateBuildProgress()` checks if builders are still alive
- Cancels build if below minimum required builders
- Properly cleans up on builder death via `EndPlay()`
- File: `BuilderComponent.cpp`

```cpp
// Check all participating builders are alive
TArray<UBuilderComponent*> AliveBuilders;
for (UBuilderComponent* Builder : ParticipatingBuilders)
{
    if (Builder && IsValid(Builder) && IsValid(Builder->GetOwner()))
    {
        AliveBuilders.Add(Builder);
    }
}

if (ParticipatingBuilders.Num() < MinBuildersRequired)
{
    CancelBuild();
}
```

### 4. MindMelder PowerfulMindmeld Fix
**Problem**: MindMelder wasn't casting its signature ability
**Solution**: Fixed multiple issues preventing execution

#### Fixes Applied:
1. **Line of Sight Check**: Fixed inverted logic
   - Was: `if (!LineTrace())` (executed when blocked)
   - Now: Properly checks if hit nothing or hit player

2. **Cooldown Reduction**: 60s → 45s for more frequent use

3. **Removed Time Requirement**: Executes immediately when in range

4. **Increased Priority**: Higher priority value (10.0) to favor this ability

Files: `PowerfulMindmeldComponent.cpp`, `MindMelderCombatState.cpp`

## Combat Flow Improvements

### Standard Enemy Engagement Pattern
1. **Close Combat**: Sword attacks and blocks
2. **Player Evasion**: After 6s without hits → Build PsiDisruptor
3. **Area Denial**: PsiDisruptor disables movement abilities
4. **Force Engagement**: Player must use Singularity or kill builders

### MindMelder Threat
- Maintains 1500-3000 unit distance
- Begins 30s channel when in range with LoS
- Forces player WP to 0 on completion
- Player must close to 300 units to interrupt

### Tactical Considerations
- PsiDisruptors force ultimate ability usage
- Building can be prevented by aggressive play
- MindMelders create time pressure
- Multiple enemy types create layered challenges

## Testing Recommendations

### Standard Enemy Building
1. Keep distance from Standard enemies for 6+ seconds
2. Verify PsiDisruptor build starts
3. Kill builders during build process
4. Confirm build interruption

### PsiDisruptor Destruction
1. Attack with normal abilities - should show immunity message
2. Use Gravity Pull Ultimate near PsiDisruptor
3. Verify destruction by Singularity only

### MindMelder Ability
1. Let MindMelder maintain distance (1500-3000 units)
2. Ensure clear line of sight
3. Verify PowerfulMindmeld channel starts
4. Test interruption by getting within 300 units

## Balance Considerations

### Positive Changes
- Forces player movement and engagement
- Creates strategic ultimate usage decisions
- Rewards aggressive play (prevents building)
- Adds urgency with MindMelder threat

### Potential Issues
- Multiple PsiDisruptors could be overwhelming
- MindMelder 30s channel might feel too long
- 6s build timer might be too short/long

### Tuning Recommendations
- Monitor PsiDisruptor spawn frequency
- Consider MindMelder channel time reduction if needed
- Adjust build timers based on playtesting

## Code Quality

### Improvements Made
- Proper null checking and validation
- Clear logging for debugging
- Consistent timer management
- Clean state transitions

### Architecture Benefits
- Modular ability components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven notifications
- Reusable building system

## Files Modified

- `MindMelderCombatState.cpp` - PowerfulMindmeld execution
- `BuilderComponent.cpp` - Builder validation

### Abilities
- `PowerfulMindmeldComponent.cpp` - Line of sight fix

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with changes
- This report - Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add UI indicators for building progress
   - Show PsiDisruptor invulnerability visually
   - MindMelder channel progress bar

2. **Audio Cues**
   - Building start/interrupt sounds
   - PsiDisruptor immunity feedback
   - MindMelder channel warning

3. **Balance Testing**
   - Fine-tune timers based on gameplay
   - Adjust ranges if needed
   - Monitor difficulty curve

The enemy AI now provides more dynamic and challenging encounters that force players to adapt their strategies and make meaningful decisions about ability usage.
