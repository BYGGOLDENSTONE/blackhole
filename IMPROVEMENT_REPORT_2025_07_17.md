# Improvement Report - 2025-07-17

## Session Overview
Major improvements to core game systems: Enhanced StatusEffectComponent with source tracking and priorities, and revolutionized enemy AI behaviors for more dynamic combat encounters.

## StatusEffectComponent Enhancements

### 1. Source Tracking System
**Problem**: No way to track who applied effects or clean up when source is destroyed
**Solution**: Added source tracking to FStatusEffect struct
- Added `TWeakObjectPtr<AActor> Source` to track effect applicator
- Added `RemoveEffectsFromSource()` for cleanup when source dies
- Updated `ApplyStatusEffect()` to accept optional source parameter
- Files: `StatusEffectComponent.h/cpp`

### 2. Priority System
**Problem**: Conflicting effects could override important ones
**Solution**: Implemented priority-based effect application
- Added `int32 Priority` to FStatusEffect
- Higher priority effects block lower priority ones
- Useful for boss abilities that shouldn't be interrupted
- Default priority is 0 for backward compatibility

### 3. Stacking Rules
**Problem**: All effects behaved the same when reapplied
**Solution**: Per-effect type stacking behaviors
- Added `EEffectStackingRule` enum
- Implemented `GetStackingRule()` with rules per effect type:
  - Stagger/Stun: Refresh duration
  - Slow/SpeedBoost: Replace with new value
  - Burn/DamageBoost: Stack up to max
  - Shield: Extend duration
  - Freeze/Knockdown/Dead: Ignore duplicates

### 4. Movement System Integration
**Problem**: Movement didn't respect status effects consistently
**Solution**: Added CanMove() checks
- Updated `Move()` to check StatusEffectComponent
- Updated `UseUtilityJump()` to check before jumping
- Updated `UseDash()` to check before dashing
- Files: `BlackholePlayerCharacter.cpp`

### 5. Ability System Integration
**Problem**: Abilities could be used while stunned/staggered
**Solution**: Added CanAct() check to AbilityComponent
- Checks StatusEffectComponent for both players and enemies
- Prevents ability use during stagger, stun, or death
- Early exit for better performance
- Files: `AbilityComponent.cpp`

## Code Quality Improvements

### Better Encapsulation
- All state queries go through StatusEffectComponent
- No duplicate state tracking in other components
- Clear separation of concerns

### Improved API
```cpp
// Old way (no tracking)
ApplyStatusEffect(Type, Duration, Magnitude);

// New way (with tracking and priority)
ApplyStatusEffect(Type, Duration, Magnitude, bAllowStacking, Source, Priority);
```

### Safety Features
- Weak pointers prevent dangling references
- Priority system prevents accidental overrides
- Stacking rules prevent effect spam

## Integration Examples

### Enemy Abilities
```cpp
// Stab attack with source tracking
StatusEffect->ApplyStatusEffect(
    EStatusEffectType::Stagger, 
    StaggerDuration, 
    1.0f, 
    false, 
    Owner  // Track who applied the stagger
);
```

### Cleanup on Death
```cpp
// Remove all effects when enemy dies
for (ACharacter* Player : AffectedPlayers)
{
    if (UStatusEffectComponent* StatusComp = Player->FindComponentByClass<UStatusEffectComponent>())
    {
        StatusComp->RemoveEffectsFromSource(this);
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Early Exit Conditions
- Movement functions exit early if effects block movement
- Ability execution checks status before other validations
- Priority checks prevent unnecessary effect applications

### Efficient State Queries
- `CanMove()` and `CanAct()` use simple boolean checks
- No complex calculations in hot paths
- Cached component references where possible

## Testing Performed

### Compilation
- All changes compile without errors
- No warnings introduced
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Integration Points
- Movement properly blocked during stagger/stun
- Abilities respect status effects
- Source tracking works with weak pointers

## Files Modified

### Core Systems
1. `StatusEffectComponent.h` - Enhanced struct and new methods
2. `StatusEffectComponent.cpp` - Implementation of new features
3. `AbilityComponent.cpp` - Added CanAct() integration
4. `BlackholePlayerCharacter.cpp` - Movement integration

### Enemy Components
1. `StabAttackComponent.cpp` - Pass source for effects
2. `ChargeAbilityComponent.cpp` - Pass source for knockdown

### Documentation
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with latest changes
2. `STATUSEFFECT_IMPROVEMENTS_2025_07_17.md` - Detailed documentation
3. This report

## Benefits

### For Developers
- Clear API for applying and managing effects
- Easy to add new effect types
- Debugging support with source tracking

### For Gameplay
- Consistent behavior across all systems
- No ability spam during stun
- Proper effect priorities for boss fights

### For Performance
- Centralized state management
- Efficient queries
- Early exit optimizations

## Next Steps

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add UI indicators for active effects
   - Show effect duration bars
   - Different colors for effect priorities

2. **Audio Integration**
   - Play sounds when effects are applied
   - Different sounds for high priority effects

3. **Balance Testing**
   - Fine-tune effect durations
   - Adjust priority levels
   - Test stacking limits

The StatusEffectComponent is now a robust, production-ready system that properly integrates with all game systems while maintaining performance and code quality.

## Enemy AI Enhancements

### 1. Standard Enemy Building Behavior
- **Added**: Build PsiDisruptor after 6 seconds without hitting player
- **Tracks**: Time since last successful hit
- **Forces**: Player engagement to prevent area denial

### 2. PsiDisruptor Invulnerability
- **Changed**: Immune to all damage except Singularity ability
- **Requires**: Ultimate Gravity Pull to destroy
- **Creates**: Strategic ultimate usage decisions

### 3. Building Interruption
- **Monitors**: Builder status during construction
- **Cancels**: Build if insufficient builders remain
- **Rewards**: Aggressive play against builders

### 4. MindMelder PowerfulMindmeld
- **Fixed**: Line of sight check logic
- **Reduced**: Cooldown from 60s to 45s
- **Removed**: Time delay requirement
- **Result**: Properly executes 30s channel to drop player WP to 0

## Combined Impact

These improvements work together to create:
- **Dynamic Combat**: Enemies adapt to player behavior
- **Strategic Depth**: Resource management becomes critical
- **Meaningful Choices**: When to use ultimates, which effects to prioritize
- **Escalating Challenge**: Area denial forces engagement

The game now features robust state management with intelligent enemy behaviors that create emergent gameplay situations.
