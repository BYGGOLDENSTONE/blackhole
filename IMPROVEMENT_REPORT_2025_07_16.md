# Improvement Report - 2025-07-16

## Session Overview
Major improvements to wall running system and agile enemy combat behavior, with focus on intentionality and aggression.

## Wall Run System Enhancements

### 1. Look Requirement for Intentional Activation
**Problem**: Wall runs were triggering accidentally during normal movement
**Solution**: Added dot product check requiring player to look at wall (40% minimum)
- Added `IsLookingAtWall()` function to check camera direction vs wall normal
- Prevents accidental activation while maintaining fluid gameplay
- File: `WallRunComponent.cpp:IsLookingAtWall()`

### 2. Free Camera Movement During Wall Run
**Problem**: Camera was locked to movement direction, preventing combat during wall runs
**Solution**: Decoupled camera from movement direction
- Removed `bOrientRotationToMovement` toggle during wall run
- Changed from `ConsumeInputVector()` to `GetLastInputVector()` to preserve input
- Players can now aim and use abilities while wall running
- File: `WallRunComponent.cpp:Tick()`

### 3. Wall Run Stability Fix
**Problem**: Rapid enter/exit cycles due to input consumption
**Solution**: Fixed input detection logic
- Removed `ConsumeInputVector()` calls that were clearing needed input
- Changed tick group to `TG_DuringPhysics` for proper timing
- File: `WallRunComponent.cpp`

## Agile Enemy Combat Overhaul

### 1. Assassin Behavior Pattern
**Implemented**: Complete assassin-style combat flow
- Maintain distance (450-550 units) → Dash at 600 range → Backstab → 3s retreat
- Custom `AgileChaseState` prevents normal chase behavior
- File: `AgileCombatState.cpp`, `AgileChaseState.cpp`

### 2. Backstab Mechanic
**Features**:
- 2x damage multiplier (configurable)
- 1.5s player stagger on hit
- Area damage (200 radius) to ensure hit detection
- Proper positioning by overshooting dash
- File: `AgileCombatState.cpp:ExecuteDashAttack()`

### 3. Player Stagger System
**New Addition**: Stagger state for player character
- Disables movement and input for duration
- Slows animation (30% speed) for visual feedback
- Clean timer-based recovery
- File: `BlackholePlayerCharacter.cpp:ApplyStagger()`

### 4. Aggressive AI Behavior
**Problem**: Enemy was too passive, maintaining distance instead of attacking
**Solution**:
- 5-second force attack timer
- Increased dash range to 600 units
- Reduced maintain distances to 450-550 (from 650-750)
- Enemy actively pursues when dash is ready
- File: `AgileCombatState.cpp:UpdateAssassinBehavior()`

### 5. Configurable Combat Stats
**New Properties** (all editable in editor):
- `BackstabStaggerDuration` - Player stagger time
- `MaintainDistanceMin/Max` - Distance keeping behavior
- `BackstabDamageMultiplier` - Damage scaling
- `RetreatDuration` - Time spent retreating
- File: `AgileEnemy.h`

## Bug Fixes

### 1. State Machine Error Spam
**Problem**: "No current state object in tick!" spam after enemy death
**Solution**: Added special handling for Dead state to disable tick
- File: `EnemyStateMachine.cpp:ChangeState()`

### 2. Lambda Capture Errors
**Problem**: Compilation errors with lambda variable captures
**Solution**: Properly accessed variables inside lambda scope
- File: `AgileCombatState.cpp`

### 3. Backstab Damage Miss
**Problem**: Backstab animation played but damage didn't apply
**Solution**: Temporarily use area damage for backstab attacks
- File: `AgileCombatState.cpp:ExecuteDashAttack()`

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Removed Redundant Code
- Eliminated duplicate state handling
- Cleaned up variable shadowing issues

### 2. Improved Debug Output
- Added phase tracking for agile combat states
- Better logging for assassin behavior
- Distance and cooldown display

### 3. Safety Improvements
- Weak pointer usage in timers
- Proper null checks
- State validation

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Wall Run Detection
- Early exit conditions for performance
- Optimized trace operations

### 2. Enemy AI
- Reduced unnecessary movement calculations
- Efficient state transitions

## Testing Notes

### Wall Run
- Tested with various approach angles
- Verified combat ability usage during wall run
- Confirmed smooth transitions

### Agile Enemy
- Tested assassin approach from various distances
- Verified backstab damage and stagger application
- Confirmed aggressive behavior with force timer

## Next Steps

### Recommended Improvements
1. **State Component System** - Centralize all state management (stagger, stun, etc.)
2. **More Enemy Types** - Implement remaining enemy variants
3. **Visual Polish** - Add effects for stagger and backstab
4. **Balance Tuning** - Fine-tune combat parameters based on playtesting
